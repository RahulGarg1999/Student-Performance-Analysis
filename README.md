# Student-Performance-Analysis

Student Academic Performance Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project investigating the factors that affect student performance, based on a publicly available dataset of student exam scores and demographic attributes.


Contents
StudentsPerformance.csv — the dataset with student scores and attributes

student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with data exploration, visualization, and insights


Dataset Description
File: StudentsPerformance.csv

This dataset includes records for multiple students with the following features:

gender — Student gender (female/male)

race/ethnicity — Student’s race/ethnicity group

parental level of education — Highest education level of parents

lunch — Type of lunch (standard/reduced)

test preparation course — Whether student completed a prep course

math score — Math exam score (0-100)

reading score — Reading exam score (0-100)

writing score — Writing exam score (0-100)


Notebook Overview
File: student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb

This notebook includes:

Data loading and preview

Data cleaning (if needed)

Descriptive statistics

Visualization of distributions and relationships

Analysis of performance by:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental education level

Lunch type

Test preparation course completion

Correlation analysis among exam scores

Insights and possible conclusions


Goals of the Analysis
Understand how demographic factors influence student academic performance

Identify trends and patterns in exam scores

Generate insights to inform education policy or intervention design


How to Run
Clone this repository

Install Jupyter and required packages (e.g. pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Open student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells


Insights (Example)
Some possible insights you might see in the notebook:

Students who completed test preparation courses tend to score higher.

Parental education level correlates with student performance.

Gender differences may appear in subject-specific scores (e.g. math vs. reading).
