# Student-Performance-Analysis

Student Academic Performance Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project investigating the factors that affect student performance, based on a publicly available dataset of student exam scores and demographic attributes.

📂 Contents
StudentsPerformance.csv — the dataset with student scores and attributes

student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with data exploration, visualization, and insights

📊 Dataset Description
File: StudentsPerformance.csv

This dataset includes records for multiple students with the following features:

gender — Student gender (female/male)

race/ethnicity — Student’s race/ethnicity group

parental level of education — Highest education level of parents

lunch — Type of lunch (standard/reduced)

test preparation course — Whether student completed a prep course

math score — Math exam score (0-100)

reading score — Reading exam score (0-100)

writing score — Writing exam score (0-100)

🧪 Notebook Overview
File: student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb

This notebook includes:

Data loading and preview

Data cleaning (if needed)

Descriptive statistics

Visualization of distributions and relationships

Analysis of performance by:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental education level

Lunch type

Test preparation course completion

Correlation analysis among exam scores

Insights and possible conclusions

📈 Goals of the Analysis
Understand how demographic factors influence student academic performance

Identify trends and patterns in exam scores

Generate insights to inform education policy or intervention design

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository

Install Jupyter and required packages (e.g. pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Open student-academic-performance-analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells

💡 Insights (Example)
Some possible insights you might see in the notebook:

Students who completed test preparation courses tend to score higher.

Parental education level correlates with student performance.

Gender differences may appear in subject-specific scores (e.g. math vs. reading).
